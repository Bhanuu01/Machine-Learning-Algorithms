# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Algorithms repository! Here, I've diligently crafted a comprehensive set of machine learning algorithms using Python, featuring essential algorithms such as:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
2. **Linear Regression**
3. **ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)**
4. **FINDS (Feature-Incremental Neural Networks for Data Streams)**
5. **CART (Classification and Regression Trees)**
6. **C4.5**
7. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
8. **Naive Bayes**
9. **Candidate Elimination**
10. **Logistic Regression**

These algorithms have been meticulously implemented from the ground up, demonstrating my expertise in algorithmic development.
